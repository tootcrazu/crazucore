                    I make mix cds! With friends sometimes! Kind of like a curated and themed small playlist, if you gave it custom jacket art and burned it onto a disc. Making little art for each one is so fun. Here are all the ones I've made!

                        While technically the first mix I made, I don't really consider it to be part of the club, since it wasn't made with any kind of theme or cohesion in mind, nor was it made to be burned to a CD. It's just kind of a collection of songs that I made a cover for. It represents my taste from the time quite well, and that's most of what there is to say. It's also a (subtle) early use of my spiral motif, so that's cool.

                    My first proper mix! As is evident from the cover style and tracklist, this was made to squish a concentrated blast of Jet Set Radio vibes onto a disc. So naturally it includes many songs from that duology, as well as it's spiritual successors in both style and gameplay (Lethal Leauge Blaze, the works of 2 Mello, and Bomb Rush Cyberfunk my GOAT). <br>
                    As to why it's called three and not one, I think I started making some others in between that I then promptly lost and/or forgot about, so I cycled the numbers back into the system for later use.

                    Now this, I'm proud of! Properly chunky amount of songs, a nice slow vs fast theme, and a lot of custom pieces. And all of it (minus the fonts I guess) was made by me! The photos were taken by me, the little drawings were made by me, even the painting on the back cover is an original dating back to when I was One year old!<br>
                    Also very fond of the colourful light images used for the >:) backgrounds. They were taken using a 'fireworks' setting on my camera at a walk-through light show. Neat stuff.<br>
                    It was a bit of a struggle to get everything printed out for the final CD case. There were twice as many parts as there were in the last one, an I foolishly didn't check the measurements and assumed they'd be same as the last case I printed for. This was incorrect. Many prints were made.

                    A lot of concepts I really like in this one. The idea to compile a bunch of cool boss fight songs was easy pickings, so the tracklist came together pretty naturally. Very happy with both the front and inside cover, the idea to go sort of OFF inspired to make a sort of non-traditional RPG style let me incorparate my spirals as well as some of my older smiley faces (I say 'my older smiley faces' but to be honest I'm not sure where most of them came from). I was also very exited to do all of the little doodles for each boss, an idea I knew I had to enact as soon as I thought of it. And they ended up mostly ok (The Burst could use a little work, and Sans looks quite baked). <br>
                    I also experimented with some track editing to make some fancy transitions this time. Didn't do it on all of them, just a touch here and there. Most noticably, the final notes of Snow Cult Scuffle transition perfectly into Polytrope, and I added a static noise and a hard cut between BIG SHOT and EchΘ Θnslaught. I also made a sort of alternate mix of Black Knife, adding Breath to the front of it, looping it twice, and adding a fade out to the end. I really like the ambiance at the start of that fight, so I wanted to keep that intact.

                        The 2025 mix! A celebration of all the new sounds I heard this year. It's got quite a bit of Gorillaz, as to be expected. That was probably a majority of my listening this year. We also have two takes from Constant Compantions (BIRDBRAIN and Rot For CLout), which was definitely my favorite album of the whole year. I honestly could've picked any two from there, it's nonstop. <br>
                        After designing the cover and the back and everything, I found out that I had some extra space on the CD, so I could add two more tracks. Took the chance to slot in KATAMARI and Do No Harm (Ventricular Mix). <br> And the cover is in fact the van I bought this year.
