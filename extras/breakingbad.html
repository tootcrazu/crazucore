                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"In Which I Watch (and write about) Every Episode of Breaking Bad"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Hello! You've discovered the part of the website where I will write about (hopefully) every episode of breaking bad, and probably better call saul too. I thought it would be fun since I've never seen either show, and people say they're the best shows ever. <br> <br>
                Here's everything I know about the show going in: <br> <br>
                    ◘ Walter White is chemistry teacher, has cancer(?) and a wife named Skylar. Jesse Pink Man is his student. Walter ropes Jesse into cooking meth. There is a lawyer named Saul.<br><br>
                    ◘ Rhea Seehorn (actor) who I know from Pluribus is in it somewhere.<br><br>
                    ◘ I've seen some assorted memes here and there (walt screaming in the car, walt and jesse high fiving, etc)<br><br>
                    ◘ From reading the wiki page from Pluribus, it seems like there's some kind of submachine gun in season 5(?)<br><br>
                    ◘ And finally, most importantly, at some point Jesse hangs out with a girl and plays Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. This is my most anticipated part of the show.<br><br>

                <h2 class="bbad-episodenumber">Season 1 Episode 1:</h2>
                <h2 class="bbad-datestamp">January 1st, 2026</h2>
                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"Walt Inhales the Phospher Gas That Makes You Good at Sex (or, Walter White and the End-Life Crisis)"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Walt's terminal cancer diagnosis leaves with little to lose and a desire to leave money for his family. He does some underwear meth cooking with an ex-student of his, making the best meth anyone's ever made, killing 1.5 guys in the process.<br><br> 
                    
                    I'm already fascinated by how much different this show is than what I had imagined, based on what little I knew. This episode puts in so much work to show you just how <i>sad</i> Walt's life is, to the point that he barely reacts when he finds out he doens't have that much of it left. For all I had known about the show going in, I'd assumed that Walt was (and this sounds stupid, but it's true) closer to a typical "Badass Male Dude". Using heavy quotes around that because the people I'm imagining are, like, the joker and the guy from fight club. The kind of people who are probably direct allegories for toxic masculinty but some people still think they're totally cool and awesome.
                    <br><br>
                I'd written in the prelude that Walt ropes Jesse into making meth, which I'd kind of assumed based on my other assumptions about Walt. Funny to see that my assumptions were kind of turned on their head, while still not being technically false. In fact, we've kind of burst through most of my knowledge about the series right here. No need to waste heaps of time on the setup.
                    <br><br>
                Have to leave a note here for my least favorite character so far, Hank. <i title="kind of an oxymoron">Racist Cop</i> who completely ruins Walt's 50th to watch a bland ass news broadcast of him on the TV. I hope he gets phospher exploded.

                <h2 class="bbad-episodenumber">Season 1 Episode 2:</h2>
                <h2 class="bbad-datestamp">January 2nd, 2026</h2>
                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"Walt Sucks at Lying, Muder, Teaching, Disposing of Bodies, and Being a Husband (or, Skyler and the Discovery of MILFs.)"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext"> Walt and Jesse deal with the fallout of the 1.5 guys Walt killed last episode, Skyler discovers something's up and traces a lead to Jesse's house, where she confronts him. <br><br>
                    
                    I had to keep adding to my title for this one as the episode went on because Walt kept doing more stupid stuff. To be honest, there's so much going on and he's so bad at it (well, him and Jesse really) that I'm shocked this show can go on for more than one season. Either they've gotta get so good at covering their tracks that they become practically invisible, or they die at the end of season one and it's the greatest plot twist in the history of tv shows. <br> <br>
                I honestly have no idea where Walt and Skyler's relationship will develop from here. I can't see Skyler staying in the dark about Walt's dealings for long (unless she just really believes in the weed dealer cover story), so is she still a character later in the show? (I also have a bad feeling that their baby daughter won't live very long.. I hope the bit about the chemicals that cause birth defects wasn't foreshadowing...)<br> <br>
                I'm also coming to realise that this show is less about "two guys that cook meth" and more "What if a regular guy got himself caught up in criminal affairs".

                <h2 class="bbad-datestamp">January 3rd, 2026</h2>
                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"The Hank and Marie Stupid Hour (or, Murder is BAD)"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">After a misunderstanding (and some just plain not listening) between Skyler and Marie, Marie sends Hank to intimidate Walt Jr out of smoking pot. Walt murders a guy in the longest, most drawn out and morally difficult way possible.<br><br>
                    
                    Absolutely my favorite episode so far. Walt talking to Krazy-8, knowing that he'll need to make a terrible choice that he doesn't like either outcome of, is the most compelling plot here yet. He desperately wants to believe that he's nice, that he can let him go, but he knows he can't trust him for sure. Writing the pro/con list is amazing characterization. Walt is so out of his depth, he's applying his regular thought processes to this absolute horror show like it's a math problem. Him noticing the broken plate shard, then, is almost an excuse. Perfect. Krazy-8 was probably the smarter person in the room, def my favortie character so far.
                    <br><br>
                 Hank continues to be awful, a trait that his wife also seems to share a little.

                <h2 class="bbad-datestamp">January 3rd, 2026</h2>
                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader" title="EXCEPT THE OTHER KID SMOKES THE WEED???">"Jesse Pinkman and the Almost Most Suburban American Family of All Time (or, 'Everybody Digs The Meth We Cooked')"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Walt finally (involunterily) tells his family about the cancer, and Jesse takes a visit back home because the meth he smoked makes him see mormons in their true form. Walt blows up an evil buisnessman's car. <br><br>

                    Jesse's family dynamic is fascinating. I'm not sure how the ages work out on him and his brother, but it seems like maybe his parents had another kid after Jesse turned out to be a bit of a dropout? Insane if true. Even more insane still, then, that the other kid seems to be still on pot behind their back. Genius. (also do they have a maid?) <br><br>

                    So much of the stuff that happened in this episode would be impossible in the current day, and it kind of made me jelous. Walt can just blow up a guy's car, in broad daylight, at a gas station, and nobody knows it was him. A million reasons that wouldn't work today, but god would it feel good <s>to do this to a tesla</s>. <br><br>

                    Love Jesse coming back to Walt in this episode after he sees that there's opportunities to make even more cash. It feels like the two are in constant cycles of trying to get out of the game > getting pulled back in by the other one.

                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"The Surprise Intervention Snack Platter (or, Walt refuses money from a rich CEO)"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Skyler & Walt visit a birthday party for Watt's old lab partner (now rich CEO), he offers to pay for the cancer treatment but Walt declines. Jesse doesn't want to work as a sign spinner so he tries making glass from scratch. After an intervention from his family, Walt decides to begin chemo.<br><br>

                    I continue to be surprised (and delighted, thought that doesn't feel like exactly the right word to use in this context) about how much more this show is about 'dealing with a terminal cancer diagnosis' than 'cool guys cook meth'. It's been some of the more compelling parts of the show so far. The intervention especially, where Walt lays out his argument against taking the treatment before ultimately deciding to anyway, was very powerful. Fascinated to learn what happened between Walt and the Rich Buisness Couple for Walt to reject both offers so completely.

                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"Walt Faces Two-Progned Hell: Chemotherapy and a Cop Coming to His Workplace (or, Walt's Really Really Lucky These Cops are Extremely Racist <i>and Dumb As Rocks</i>)"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">As the chemo starts showing it's effects on Walt, the police track a discarded respirator back to Walt's School, and end up arresting a cool janitor because they're racist. Jesse fails his speech check with the biggest meth distributor in town and gets beat up, so Walt has to come in and blow them up to get their money.<br><br>

                    I'm beginning to see the tramsformation from regular man Walter White to the badass meth cooking bald old man "Heisenberg" from my original conception of this show. Granted, his plan was insane, and none of that should've worked the way it did, but it was badass. ( wonder if there's an explanation as to why he chose Heisenberg? I'm not sure if it's explained later in the series (or earlier and I missed it), but either way I'm scared to google it in case of spoilers.)<br><br>
                    Backtracking to a little earlier in the episode, the poker scene was so characterful, especially in how Walt reacts to Hank boasting about arresting Hugo. It's in reaction to this that Walt stares at Hank and says "I'm going all in" and we the audience are like "ah, I see, he's talking about the meth". Also the face Walt makes when Hank says he wouldn't be able to recogise a criminal is so fucking funny.

                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"Awkward Social Situations Induce Physical Pain in Me, the Viewer (or, Walt and Jesse's Silly Heist)"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Skyler tries to return a baby shower gift from Marie, realizing she shoplifted it. Walt and Jesse come up on some buisness trouble, end up stealing some chemicals and cooking in the basement of Jesse's open home.<br><br>

                    This is the one where Walt puts on the hat! He also, despite being a fictional character, manages to induce a stress response in me in real life. I have a weakness to awkward situations, so Walt and Jesse cooking at the open home instilled fear in me. Good thing they didn't linger on it too long.
                    <br><br>
                    If I'm correct, this is the final episode of Season 1! We end on what very much seems like a 'season 2 hook', Walt and Jesse realising that they're in for good and it's gonna take a lot of effort to get them out. If I keep up a pace like this, I might be finished with the whole show before the end of January...

                    First episdode of the second season, they really start shit up. Everyone is kind of only getting worse. Walt is treating Skyler worse and worse, and it's kind of infuriating to watch. I look forward to (hopefully) watch him get better.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, Skyler is my new favorite character. She's just kind of trying her best to stay together. I hope she makes it out.

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Walt and Jesse escape Tuco's kidnapping, and Skyler puts out the missing persons report for Walt.<br><br>

                    Absolutely the best episode so far. The kind of television to keep you twisted in a suspenseful pretzel for the entire hour long runtine. They take a lot of care to slowly set up a lot of dominoes, so many possible plot points that could reslove by the end that by the time Hank shows up, I was actually happy. Walt and Jessie bickering about the possible murder methods was also peak. Jesse could not help making murder jokes about the laced crack.
                    <br><br>
                    This episode was a rare good showing for Hank. Asside from the first part I think, he really seemed more compitent than he usually did.
                    <br><br>
                    I genuiniely don't know how much longer Walt can keep everyone in the dark. He seemed like he was on such thin ice last season, we're on the second out of 5 and he's already gone publicly missing, and now Hank is practically within sniffing distance (though he doesn't know it).

                    Walter White loves lying to his wife. It's his favorite thing to do. He's terrible at it, and she never believes him, but he does it anyway. I'm not even sure he loves her. He does do a funny bit pretending like he was gonna go to 7/11 naked.
                    <br><br>
                    Hank completely un-redeemed himself this episode this time. Mega racist, trying to force confessions out of everyone. Also the police station makes him a cake to celebrate killing a guy in a shootout? jesus.

                    Walt is really laying on thick here, and it's kind of freaky to watch. It feels like Skyler has flipped the roles intentionally on him, and it's kind of fascinating to wtch. It feels like he doesn't know what to do. I love it. She knows exactly what she's doing. Especially at the end.

                    Jesse's having the no good very bad worst days of his life. He turns sad and blue :(. The final scene was so good. Love it. Starting with them in a looney tunes ass fight cloud and ending with sulking in the kitchen over breakfast...

                    Almost everyone except Skyler continues to be silly in this episode. Walt's lack of self awareness continues to baffle, and Jesse digs himself deeper.
