                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"In Which I Watch (and write about) Every Episode of Breaking Bad"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Hello! You've discovered the part of the website where I will write about (hopefully) every episode of breaking bad, and probably better call saul too. I thought it would be fun since I've never seen either show, and people say they're the best shows ever. <br> <br>
                Here's everything I know about the show going in: <br> <br>
                    ◘ Walter White is chemistry teacher, has cancer(?) and a wife named Skylar. Jesse Pink Man is his student. Walter ropes Jesse into cooking meth. There is a lawyer named Saul.<br><br>
                    ◘ Rhea Seehorn (actor) who I know from Pluribus is in it somewhere.<br><br>
                    ◘ I've seen some assorted memes here and there (walt screaming in the car, walt and jesse high fiving, etc)<br><br>
                    ◘ From reading the wiki page from Pluribus, it seems like there's some kind of submachine gun in season 5(?)<br><br>
                    ◘ And finally, most importantly, at some point Jesse hangs out with a girl and plays Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. This is my most anticipated part of the show.<br><br>

                <h2 class="bbad-episodenumber">Season 1 Episode 1:</h2>
                <h2 class="bbad-datestamp">January 1st, 2026</h2>
                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"Walt Inhales the Phospher Gas That Makes You Good at Sex (or, Walter White and the End-Life Crisis)"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext"> I'm already fascinated by how much different this show is than what I had imagined, based on what little I knew. This episode puts in so much work to show you just how <i>sad</i> Walt's life is, to the point that he barely reacts when he finds out he doens't have that much of it left. For all I had known about the show going in, I'd assumed that Walt was (and this sounds stupid, but it's true) closer to a typical "Badass Male Dude". Using heavy quotes around that because the people I'm imagining are, like, the joker and the guy from fight club. The kind of people who are probably direct allegories for toxic masculinty but some people still think they're totally cool and awesome.
                    <br><br>
                I'd written in the prelude that Walt ropes Jesse into making meth, which I'd kind of assumed based on my other assumptions about Walt. Funny to see that my assumptions were kind of turned on their head, while still not being technically false. In fact, we've kind of burst through most of my knowledge about the series right here. No need to waste heaps of time on the setup.
                    <br><br>
                Have to leave a note here for my least favorite character so far, Hank. <i title="kind of an oxymoron">Racist Cop</i> who completely ruins Walt's 50th to watch a bland ass news broadcast of him on the TV. I hope he gets phospher exploded.

                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"Walt Sucks at Lying, Muder, Teaching, Disposing of Bodies, and Being a Husband (or, Skyler and the Discovery of MILFs.)"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext"> I had to keep adding to my title for this one as the episode went on because Walt kept doing more stupid stuff. To be honest, there's so much going on and he's so bad at it (well, him and Jesse really) that I'm shocked this show can go on for more than one season. Either they've gotta get so good at covering their tracks that they become practically invisible, or they die at the end of season one and it's the greatest plot twist in the history of tv shows. <br> <br>
                I honestly have no idea where Walt and Skyler's relationship will develop from here. I can't see Skyler staying in the dark about Walt's dealings for long (unless she just really believes in the weed dealer cover story), so is she still a character later in the show? (I also have a bad feeling that their baby daughter won't live very long.. I hope the bit about the chemicals that cause birth defects wasn't foreshadowing...)<br> <br>
                I'm also coming to realise that this show is less about "two guys that cook meth" and more "What if a regular guy got himself caught up in criminal affairs".

                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">"The Hank and Marie Stupid Hour (or, Murder is BAD)"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Absolutely my favorite episode so far. Walt talking to Krazy-8, knowing that he'll need to make a terrible choice that he doesn't like either outcome of, is the most compelling plot here yet. He desperately wants to believe that he's nice, that he can let him go, but he knows he can't trust him for sure. Writing the pro/con list is amazing characterization. Walt is so out of his depth, he's applying his regular thought processes to this absolute horror show like it's a math problem. Him noticing the broken plate shard, then, is almost an excuse. Perfect. Krazy-8 was probably the smarter person in the room, def my favortie character so far.
                    <br><br>
                 Hank continues to be awful, a trait that his wife also seems to share a little.

                <h2 class="bbad-datestamp">January 3rd, 2026</h2>
                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader" title="EXCEPT THE OTHER KID SMOKES THE WEED???">"Jesse Pinkman and the Almost Most Suburban American Family of All Time (or, 'Everybody Digs The Meth We Cooked')"</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Walt finally (involunterily) tells his family about the cancer, and Jesse takes a visit back home because the meth he smoked makes him see mormons in their true form. Walt blows up an evil buisnessman's car. <br><br>

                    Jesse's family dynamic is fascinating. I'm not sure how the ages work out on him and his brother, but it seems like maybe his parents had another kid after Jesse turned out to be a bit of a dropout? Insane if true. Even more insane still, then, that the other kid seems to be still on pot behind their back. Genius. (also do they have a maid?) <br><br>

                    So much of the stuff that happened in this episode would be impossible in the current day, and it kind of made me jelous. Walt can just blow up a guy's car, in broad daylight, at a gas station, and nobody knows it was him. A million reasons that wouldn't work today, but god would it feel good <s>to do this to a tesla</s>. <br><br>

                    Love Jesse coming back to Walt in this episode after he sees that there's opportunities to make even more cash. It feels like the two are in constant cycles of trying to get out of the game > getting pulled back in by the other one.
