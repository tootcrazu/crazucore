                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">In Which I Watch (and write about) Every Episode of Breaking Bad</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext">Hello! You've discovered the part of the website where I will write about (hopefully) every episode of breaking bad, and probably better call saul too. I thought it would be fun since I've never seen either show, and people say they're the best shows ever. <br> <br>
                Here's everything I know about the show going in: <br> <br>
                    ◘ Walter White is chemistry teacher, has cancer(?) and a wife named Skylar. Jesse Pink Man is his student. Walter ropes Jesse into cooking meth. There is a lawyer named Saul.<br><br>
                    ◘ Rhea Seehorn (actor) who I know from Pluribus is in it somewhere.<br><br>
                    ◘ I've seen some assorted memes here and there (walt screaming in the car, walt and jesse high fiving, etc)<br><br>
                    ◘ From reading the wiki page from Pluribus, it seems like there's some kind of submachine gun in season 5(?)<br><br>
                    ◘ And finally, most importantly, at some point Jesse hangs out with a girl and plays Sonic and Sega All Stars Racing. This is my most anticipated part of the show.<br><br>

                <h1 class="bbad-entryheader">Walt Inhales the Phospher Gas That Makes You Good at Sex (a.k.a Walter White and the End-Life Crisis)</h1>

                <p class="bbad-maintext"> I'm already fascinated by how much different this show is than what I had imagined, based on what little I knew. This episode puts in so much work to show you just how <i>sad</i> Walt's life is, to the point that he barely reacts when he finds out he doens't have that much of it left. For all I had known about the show going in, I'd assumed that Walt was (and this sounds stupid, but it's true) closer to a typical "Badass Male Dude". Using heavy quotes around that because the people I'm imagining are, like, the joker and the guy from fight club. The kind of people who are probably direct allegories for toxic masculinty but some people still think they're totally cool and awesome.
                    <br><br>
                I'd written in the prelude that Walt ropes Jesse into making meth, which I'd kind of assumed based on my other assumptions about Walt. Funny to see that my assumptions were kind of turned on their head, while still not being technically false. In fact, we've kind of burst through most of my knowledge about the series right here. No need to waste heaps of time on the setup.
                    <br><br>
                Have to leave a note here for my least favorite character so far, Hank. <i title="kind of an oxymoron">Racist Cop</i> who completely ruins Walt's 50th to watch a bland ass news broadcast of him on the TV. Walt, give him the phospher explosion.
